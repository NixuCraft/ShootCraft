# Explanation:
# April 2nd, 2024. (should've made this a day earlier with how this thing works)
# Tried to get hotswap working on VSCode with gradle. Unfortunately, Gradle for VSCode doesn't support hotswap (ðŸ¤¡),
# So I had to make things work using Gradle alone
# Fought for a few hours trying to get the config to recognize, turns out it needs to be inside of the jar + 
# it doesn't log ANYTHING when it gets loaded (even invalid properties) so you don't actually know if it's
# loaded until you actually have one of its properties working.
# Once that was done, I tried simply watching for "classes/java/main". Problem is when I did that, I got:
# HOTSWAP AGENT: WARNING (org.hotswap.agent.watch.nio.WatcherNIO2) - Watcher on /home/nix/coding/minecraft/LobbyPlugin/build/classes/java/main/me/nixuge/lobby/lobbygame/snake not valid, removing path=
# with any classes I was doing. Actually the hotswap was half working, because after a /rl it did get applied for some reason.
# However, I wanted to reload things instantly.
# What I did was make a new task (customCopyChangedClasses, gpt helped) that itself gets called once ./gradlew classes 
# is done and that's going to compare the output of gradles classes & the content of another_build,
# and copy the changed files inside of another_build.
# (before i had it just copy the entire dir, but that made the server reload the whole plugin which is meh.)
# This is the reason there's an another_build folder here.
another_build/

# Placed there because I don't want to accidentally delete it (like i do for .gradle/)
